# Synthetic-Boat-Re-Identification-Dataset


## Description
Re-identification (Re-ID) is an important application in the computer vision, which can be widely used in many
maritime tasks, such as search, rescue and surveillance, etc. However, advanced boat Re-ID algorithms require large-scale
Re-ID datasets for model training and testing. This project proposes a novel method to automatically collect photo-realistic
synthetic dataset for boat Re-ID research. The synthetic dataset contains 107 boat models and various visual conditions in 36
real backgrounds. But the synthetic datasets do not always can handle real-world problems well. Therefore, we present a transfer
learning approach that uses both real and synthetic data to train more robust models. This synthetic dataset is a photo-realistic 
vision laboratory that validates the performance of different methods.
